Lacked
------
Things the team could have done better during the iteration.
- Integration (9 votes)
    - Focus on integration between Ui and backend
    - Integration progress was not as much as I hoped for, but still a good start
- Break took away work time (1 vote)
    - I wish we could have done more, but it was hard because of blockers and thanksgiving break taking up the sprint. hopefully we'll tackle it during our hackathon
    - half the sprint is gone due to break haha, wish we had more time! (from LONGED FOR)
    - Powell having started this project in Week 1 so we would have less distraction during the Thanksgiving break (from LONGED FOR)
- Bottleneck (6 votes)
    - There was a bottleneck in frontend where a lot of other people had issues that relied on one issue getting finished before they could start.
    - Focus on the task at hand, kinda kept thinking about additional stuff that might be needed which kept the PR open for too long
- Seemed mostly fine to me (0 votes)
- More time devoted to dev work (0 votes)
Longed For
----------
Things desired during the iteration that were not available.
- Communication (14 votes)
    - More updates from the frontend side
    - Some more communication about progress or lack of assigned issues (but understand that it was likely due to Thanksgiving)
    - Some more direction, not too sure on what to do atm
    - Better documentation  (from LACKED)
