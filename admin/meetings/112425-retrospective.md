Retrium Retrospective, November 25, 2025
Technique: Mad, Sad, Glad
========================================

Mad
---
Things that frustrated you in the last iteration.

- Unbothered (2 votes)
    - Nope
    - Nothing made me mad
    - not much (from SAD)
- merge conflicts (3 votes)
- using frameworks would have significantly decreased the amount of time we spent on some (frontend ui implementation) things :') (1 vote)
- Was unfamiliar with the problem in the issue. I liked past issues that had links to similar ideas. (2 votes)
- (personally) AWS is really not that great. Unable to connect to the instance frequently. But we don't really have time to explore other approaches I guess.  (0 votes)

Sad
---
Things that disappointed you in the last iteration.

- Time constraints (4 votes)
    - I do not think I will be thankful for this project this Thanksgiving :(
    - I need to personally get more stuff done - lead up to the holiday has been distracting :(

- Slow progress..? (14 votes)
    - The prof did not look super impressed with our demo
    - Feels like we are lacking in comparison to other teams (from MAD)
    - I’m a bit worried about the frontend timeline — is everything going smoothly?
    - Trade-off between following processes vs getting things done within the limited time we have is difficult to manage.
    - Again, I feel that there isn't enough time to complete a full project. Sad because I think we could make something really good given more time.
- I wish we wired things up a little more, but that will be easy in the next sprint (1 vote)
- Reading assignment is super distracting to the project to be honest... (4 votes)

    - joint frontend/backend team meeting was very productive and helped everyone get on the same page
