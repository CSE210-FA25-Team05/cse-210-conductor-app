## Follow-up

- Once issues are completed there should be a follow-up.
- The issue should have follow-up solutions as we wrap up things, rather than creating several sub-issues.
- Want to begin addressing functionalities now that we've gotten things done.
- Need to update presentation as a result.
- People are doing duplicates of some issues.
- There was some rework needed on the database end just to clarify some of the backend issues that were at play.
