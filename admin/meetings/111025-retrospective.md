========================================
Mad
---
Add notes about things that frustrated you in the last iteration.
- Clarification (10 votes)
    - I think we need to prioritize forming a solid direction as much as we prioritize building and coding
    - Hard to assign issues when they build off of eachother. need to prioritize issues better
    - It felt pretty confusing on what to do at the start.
    - Felt like I didn't know where to start on the project for frontend. 
-  (3 votes)
    - Failed to get everyone issues to work on. However, it is difficult at the start of a project
    - There are a lot of confusions about what to do for this sprint because 1. the issue itself is a little too vague and 2. we still do not have a clear mind about the structure of the project. 
    - No concrete direction or goal on what to do, partially due to a lot of ideating which is good
    - Sprint 1 came in like a wrecking ball
- Happy people (0 votes)
    - Nothing made me mad
    - N/A
- Is there a way to link github to slack? Itll be helpful to keep things up to date (3 votes)
Sad
---
Add notes about things that disappointed you in the last iteration.
- cross-team communication (12 votes)
    - I think there should be more communication between sub teams in general
    - I feel we needed to have a bit more planning and better communication across teams.
- within-team communication (7 votes)
    - For frontend I think we should have a team meeting on top of the all hands meeting
    - I felt a lack of sense of direction on what specifically to do. Overall tasks felt vague, and subteam didn't sync up very much on how to handle them
    - Work in my subteam felt more individual than group effort
-  (3 votes)
    - Didn't get as much work done as I wanted to.
    - Timing wise for me is it was really bad with like 2 midterms and interviews and stuff
    - Wish we might have gotten a little more done, but given the time constraints it seems appropriate for what we did
- As the Infrastructure (Security) team, we held the meeting so late that we cannot finish the issues assigned in time because there is no "leader" to set a deadline for the matters.  (1 vote)
- went so fast  (1 vote)
- Handling the uncertainty of continuing dev work while waiting on big decisions is a pain. (1 vote)
- Disappointed to send Issues too late   (0 votes)
